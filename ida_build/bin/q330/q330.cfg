# Configuration file used to simplify dealing with Q330 digitizers.
# The general format is a tag, followed by a variable number of parameters,
# depending on the particular tag.  Blank lines, and everything from the #
# character to the end of the line are ignored
#
# The "q330" tag is used to specify the Q330 "address" and consists of 3 items:
#   1 - The name of the digitizer.  This MUST match the name given in /etc/hosts!
#   2 - The digitizer serial number (16 hexadecimal digits)
#   3 - The authentication code (16 hexadecimal digits, normally it is zero)

#     Name    Serial Number     Auth code

# The "detector" tag is used to specify the qhlp event detector and consists
# of a variable number of items.  The first 6 are always the same:
#
#   1 - The site name for which this is to be applied, or "default"
#   2 - A comma delimited string listing the names of the triggered channels
#   3 - mininum number of "on" channels required to declare an event
#   4 - Pre-event memory, in packets
#   5 - Post-event memory, in packets
#   6 - Type of detector.  Currently only "stalta" is supported.
#
# The remaining parameters are specific to the type of detector.  For stalta
#
#   7 - STA window length, in samples
#   8 - LTA window length, in samples
#   9 - STA/LTA ratio needed to transition from off to on
#  10 - STA/LTA ratio needed to transition from on to off

#           Site     Channels      Votes Pre Post  Type  STA  LTA  On  Off

# The "calib" tag is used to specify the default calibration parameters
# and consists of exactly 8 parameters:
#
#   1 - Waveform code (0=sine 1=red noise 2=white noise 3=step 4=random binary
#   2 - Amplitude bits shifted (0=-6db 1=-12db, etc)
#   3 - duration in seconds
#   4 - settling time in seconds
#   5 - trailer time in seconds
#   6 - calibration channels bitmap
#   7 - monitor channels bitmap
#   8 - frequency divider
#       (1=1Hz sine or 125Hz update freq, 20=0.05Hz sine or 6.26Hz update, max=255)
#
#  The following is for a maximum duration, maximum amplitude, maximum period random
#  binary calibration on channels 1, 2, and 3 with the input recorded on channel 4.
#  Note: Maximum duration is 4.5 hours (approx), maximum period is 2.04 seconds.
