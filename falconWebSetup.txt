Falcon Web consists of 6 main components.

1. falconalarm - This is built in the falconweb directory.
2. falconweb - This is built in the falconweb directory. This build falcon.html.
3. ofadump - This is called by falconalarm and is built in the ofc_utils directory.
4. mergeopaque - This is built in the falconweb directory.
5. ofcweb.jar - This is built by running ant in the ofcweb directory.
6. html code - This is found in falconweb and includes html, javascript, and css.

Parts 1-4 need to be in the user's path. Parts 5-6 need to be in the web folder.


Usage:
To use you need a script like this:
    cd $AVAILDIR/falcon
    falconalarm -network IU -station XX_ASPX -days 60 -dir .
    falconweb -d . -t 60
    find . -name '*_ofc.seed' -exec mergeopaque {} {}.hist \;
    find . -name '*_ofa.seed' -exec mergeopaque {} {}.hist \;

This script was taken from aslwww when it was taken down. You need to execute
it in the web directory. The -station XX_ASPX part is not fully understood yet.
The purpose of mergeopaque is not understood either.

Update this document, if you understand anything more than what is here.
